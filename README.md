## How to customize this structure in a new repo

If you want to use this structure in a new repo, this are the step for taking the files from this repo and customizing it:
1. Copy the file `.gitpod.yml` and the directories `dockerfiles` and `.github/workflows` in the new repo.
1. In `.gitpod.yml` file, change the line `image: ghcr.io/traversaro/gitpod-ubuntu-20.04:latest` to `image: ghcr.io/<organization>/<repo>:latest`.
1. In `.github/workflows/publish-docker.yml` file, change the line `name: traversaro/gitpod-ubuntu-20.04` to `name: <organization>/<repo>`.
1. Modify `dockerfiles/Dockerfile`. In particular, modify the lines that start with `LABEL` to describe your repo, and add the necessary installation step for your software as `RUN` lines. For more info, check the [reference documentation on Dockerfiles](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/).
